# Universal-AI-Assisted-Development-Guidelines

*Language and framework agnostic guidelines for effective AI-assisted software development*

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides universal principles and practices for organizing any software project to maximize the effectiveness of AI coding assistants while maintaining excellent human developer experience.

## 🏗️ Foundation Principles

### 1. Documentation as Code

Treat documentation with the same rigor as code:

- Version control all documentation
- Review documentation changes
- Test documentation accuracy
- Automate where possible

### 2. Context Window Economy

AI assistants have limited context windows. Optimize for:

- Minimal but sufficient information
- On-demand loading of details
- Clear hierarchical organization
- Efficient information retrieval

### 3. Human-AI Parity

If an AI needs information, a human probably does too:

- Never create AI-only documentation
- Make all guidance accessible to both
- Use clear, unambiguous language
- Avoid implicit knowledge assumptions

## 📋 Core Development Rules

### Always Document These

1. **Setup Instructions**: How to get started from zero
2. **Common Commands**: Frequently used operations
3. **Architecture Decisions**: Why things are built this way
4. **API Contracts**: What interfaces must be respected
5. **Testing Strategy**: How to verify changes
6. **Deployment Process**: How to ship to production

### Universal Best Practices

### Code Quality

- **Constants over Magic Values**: Never hardcode
- **Error Handling**: Always user-friendly messages
- **Testing**: Required for all changes
- **Code Review**: No exceptions

### Documentation

- **Update with Code**: Documentation is part of the change
- **Clear Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Status Tracking**: Mark proposals/deprecated items
- **Date Everything**: Track when things change

### Development Process

1. **Check Existing Patterns**: Don't reinvent
2. **Read Documentation First**: Understand before coding
3. **Test Your Changes**: Automated and manual
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep it current
5. **Review Your Work**: Self-review before submission

# Project Name Guidelines

## Overview
[2-3 line project description]

## Core Rules
- Rule 1: [Most important principle]
- Rule 2: [Second principle]
- Testing: [Testing requirement]
- Documentation: Update when changing

## Quick Reference
- Setup: See docs/facts/setup.md
- Commands: See docs/facts/commands.md
- Architecture: See docs/guides/architecture.md

## Auto-loaded
@import docs/facts/common_tasks.md

## For specific tasks
Use: @import docs/facts/[task].md

```

### Metadata Standards

Every documentation file should include:

```yaml
---
title: Clear Title
type: fact|guide|decision|proposal
tags: [relevant, search, terms]
status: draft|active|deprecated
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
priority: high|medium|low
---

```

## 🚦 Quality Checklist

### Before Starting Any Task

- [ ]  Is there existing code/pattern for this?
- [ ]  Have I read relevant documentation?
- [ ]  Do I understand the constraints?
- [ ]  Is my approach documented?

### During Development

- [ ]  Am I following established patterns?
- [ ]  Have I handled errors gracefully?
- [ ]  Are my changes testable?
- [ ]  Is my code self-documenting?

### Before Completion

- [ ]  Are all tests passing?
- [ ]  Is documentation updated?
- [ ]  Have I self-reviewed?
- [ ]  Are there no TODOs left?

## 🌍 Language-Specific Adaptations

While these guidelines are universal, adapt them to your ecosystem:

### For Compiled Languages (C++, Rust, Go)

- Document build configurations
- Include performance considerations
- Specify memory management rules

### For Interpreted Languages (Python, Ruby, JavaScript)

- Document environment setup
- Include dependency management
- Specify version requirements

### For Mobile Development (iOS, Android)

- Document platform-specific requirements
- Include UI/UX guidelines
- Specify device testing needs

### For Web Development

- Document browser compatibility
- Include accessibility requirements
- Specify responsive design needs

## 📊 Success Metrics

Your documentation is effective when:

- New developers are productive in <1 day
- AI assistants give relevant suggestions
- Common questions have findable answers
- Documentation stays current with code
- Team actively maintains docs

## 🚨 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Documentation Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Outdated examples
- ❌ Missing setup steps
- ❌ Undocumented gotchas
- ❌ Circular dependencies
- ❌ "Ask senior developer"

### Code Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Magic numbers/strings
- ❌ Unclear error messages
- ❌ Missing tests
- ❌ Inconsistent patterns
- ❌ Undocumented hacks

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

### Weekly

- Review new code for patterns
- Update commonly asked questions
- Archive outdated proposals

### Monthly

- Audit documentation accuracy
- Update architecture diagrams
- Review decision records

### Quarterly

- Major documentation cleanup
- Re-evaluate guidelines
- Team retrospective

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

1. **Start Small**: Don't document everything at once
2. **Be Consistent**: Patterns matter more than perfection
3. **Stay Current**: Outdated docs are worse than no docs
4. **Think Retrieval**: How will someone find this?
5. **Measure Success**: Track what works
